<h1>How to Setup a Basic Home Lab running Active Directory (Oracle Virtual Box) and add users with PowerShell</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project will guide you through the process of creating a simulated corporate network environment within a virtualized home lab. Using Oracle VirtualBox, you will set up a domain controller running Windows Server 2022 and join a Windows 10 client machine to the domain. The core of this lab is Active Directory, a critical service for managing network resources and user access. You will learn how to install and configure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and use PowerShell to automate the creation and management of user accounts.
<br />


<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<b>In this lab, you will set up:</b> 
- <b>Virtual Machine Setup: You will create and configure two virtual machines in Oracle VirtualBox: a Windows Server 2022 instance to act as the domain controller and a Windows 10 instance to serve as a client machine.</b> 
- <b>Network Configuration: You will establish a private network using VirtualBox's NAT Network feature to allow these virtual machines to communicate with each other.</b>
- <b>Active Directory Installation: You will install the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role on the Windows Server and promote it to a domain controller, creating a new forest and domain.</b>
- <b>Client Integration: You will join the Windows 10 client machine to the newly created domain.</b>
- <b>PowerShell for User Management: You will use PowerShell cmdlets to add, remove, and manage user accounts, demonstrating the power of automation in a network administration context..</b>


<h2>What You Will Learn </h2>

<b>By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience in:</b>
- <b>Virtualization Fundamentals: Gain hands-on experience with Oracle VirtualBox to create, configure, and manage virtual machines.</b>
- <b>Active Directory Administration: Understand the core components of Active Directory, including domains, forests, and organizational units (OUs). Learn how to install and configure a domain controller.</b>
- <b>Networking Basics: Learn to set up a private virtual network and assign static IP addresses.</b>
- <b>PowerShell Scripting: Develop basic scripting skills by using PowerShell to automate user management tasks, a highly sought-after skill for IT professionals.</b>
- <b>System Administration: Practice best practices for a multi-server environment, including host naming and IP address management.</b>


<h2>Why This Project Matters:</h2>

<b>This project provides a foundational, hands-on experience with the technologies that form the backbone of most corporate IT infrastructures:</b>

<b>Career Readiness: Active Directory and PowerShell are essential skills for anyone pursuing a career in system administration, cybersecurity, or network engineering. This project builds practical, resume-worthy experience.</b>

<b>Security Concepts: A controlled lab environment allows you to safely explore security principles and the importance of centralized user management. You can experiment with user permissions and group policies without affecting a production network.</b>

<b>Problem-Solving Skills: You will face and solve common IT challenges related to networking, server configuration, and client-server communication, honing your critical thinking and troubleshooting abilities.</b>

<b>Cost-Effective Learning: A virtualized home lab is a powerful and free way to gain real-world experience. It allows for experimentation and learning without the need for expensive hardware.</b>
